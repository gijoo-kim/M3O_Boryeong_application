### M3O application on Boryeong Reservoir
This repository is an application of M3O Matlab toolbox for designing optimal operations of multipurpose water reservoir systems. This application of the M3O toolbox on Boryeong Dam located in South Korea aims to derive optimal solutions using DDP-Perfect, DDP-Average, SDP, and three EMODPS models each with different number of parameters and shapes of approximating functions. Then their performances are measured under discrete set of inflow series using K-fold Cross Validation method (K=4). Also, the effect of incorporation of a zone-based hedging rule is also explored during simulation.

This code is used to generate dataset and consequently figures used in: Kim, Gi Joo and Kim, Young-Oh. "How does the coupling real-world policies with optimization models expand the practicality of solutions in reservoir operations problems?" currently submitted to Water Resources Management.
